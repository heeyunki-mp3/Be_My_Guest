# Be_My_Guest
Explore my lounge! 
It is a cleaned version of my last AP CSA project. 

!!!! Use AWSD to move around !!!!

For the talker event (the women NPC at the left), if you input an unknown string, it asks what it means on the console. So, if it freeze, please check your console. 

Sorry guys for not putting javadoc and comments... But there are some :D 
I will add that soon...

-> things I might add:
 1) another NPC in the lounge that distributes pokemon
 2) NPCs walking around the night street view
 3) Volume control 
 4) Update talker GUI
