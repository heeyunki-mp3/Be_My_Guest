# Be_My_Guest
Explore my lounge! 

Use AWSD to move around my lounge. Walk to another character and interact with them!

For the talker event (the women NPC at the left), if you input an unknown string, it asks what it means on the console. So, if it freeze, please check your console. 

Sorry for not putting javadoc and comments... 
I will add that soon...

-> Things I might add:
 1) another NPC in the lounge that distributes pokemon
 2) NPCs walking around the night street view
 3) Volume control 
 4) Update talker GUI
